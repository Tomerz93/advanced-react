*Advanced React - PluralSight Course by Samer Buna*

This is my personal code when following along with the course material. As of July 2019.

See package.json for commands. The git history maps to the course modules 1 to 1.

Before running project, you need to go into lib/state-api - install packages and build project (has its own specific package.json)
